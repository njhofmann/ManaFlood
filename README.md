# ManaFlood

Desktop application for deck building, deck testing, card querying, etc. for the Magic: The Gathering TCG.

Focused on covered "main" MTG sets - not silver bordered sets like Unhinged. This functionality might be supported in the future, but as of now they are not.

All data drawn from [MTGJSON](https://mtgjson.com/). Card images drawn from the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api).

Built atop Java 11, SQLite, [SQLite-JDBC](https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/downloads/), and JavaFX.
